This program was completed using pair programming.
Partner:  Benjamin Ross (bpross@ucsc.edu)
Partner:  Erik Steggall (esteggal@ucsc.edu)

We acknowledge that each partner in a programming pair should
drive roughly 50% of the time the pair is working together, and
at most 25% of an individual's effort for an assignment should
be spent working alone.  Any work done by a solitary programmer
must be reviewed by the partner.  The object is to work
together, learning from each other, not to divide the work into
two pieces with each partner working on a different piece.

Benjamin spent       10 hours working alone.
Erik spent           10 hours working alone.
We spent             25 hours working together.
Bejamin spent        20 hours driving.
Erik spent           20 hours driving.
